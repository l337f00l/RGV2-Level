;; Boomerang/Hammer Mario Power code, by ICB. Based on Ice Power by mikeyk
;; (or should I call it "Extended Sprite Shooting Ability for Mario"?)
;;
;; Description: This is a code that allows Big Mario to shoot boomerangs and hammers (any extended sprite really)
;; if their respective values are set (Using PowerUp Sprite).
;;
;; This code can be used in levels (if you want to restrict powers for one or another level) or put as Gamemode 14 code.
;; It must be enabled in levels with Power-up sprite, otherwise it won't work.
;;
;; Requires 3 bytes of freeRAM.

;Item box variables
;VanillaDisplay, if enabled, allows custom power display with a sprite tile. for more info on display see CustomItemStatusBar from Library.
;Following defines are mostly related with it's functionality.

	!VanillaDisplay = 0

;ItemDropYPos and ItemDropXPos are Y and X positions  where item is dropped. ItemDropYPos is lower than ItemYPos, which is how it is in vanilla SMW.
;ItemToDrop contains sprite numbers of power-ups themselves.

;drop positions
	!ItemDropXPos = $78
	!ItemDropYPos = $20

;sprite number of dropped item
ItemToDrop:
	db $00,$01,$02,$03,$04

;power-up values for each dropped item (probably unecessary)
;PowerValues:
;db $00,$01,$02,$03,$04

;DropItemButton - button used for the item drop (uses RAM $16)
;InstaDrop - this option makes power-up appear at the player's position just like HammerBrother's "Item Box to Player Position" patch. yeah, it's not actually instant like "Instant Item Box" patch. i'll probably implement that as well.
;DropOnHurt - custom item will instantly drop when you take damage. vanilla stuff. to disable, set to 0.
;everything else should be self-explanatory.

	!DropItemButton = $20

	!InstaDrop = 0
	!DropOnHurt = 1

;Misc and options:
;ExtendedOffset doesn't needs to be edited.
;HowManyOnScreen is a limit of how many projectiles can be on screen.
;E.G. you can't shoot any more if there's already 2 of them on screen, just like mario's fireballs. You can disable it with !LimitedSpawn setting
;Delay is a delay timer between each extended sprite spawn.
;CustomPalettes enables palette for player when having custom power. I limited it to one color change because of potential processor costs. just to be sure.

	!LimitedSpawn = 0

	!CustomPalettes = 1

	!Delay = $0C
	!HowManyOnScreen = $02
	!ExtendedOffset = $13		;From PIXI

;FreeRAM:
;Free RAM byte 1 is "Have custom power" flag and "Extended sprite to shoot" pointer.
;Free RAM byte 2 is "Shooting countdown timer", that doesn't let's you instantly throw projectile after one or another (it won't work with scratch rams)
;Free RAM byte 3 is custom power-up item box value (basically Free RAM byte 1 value for the item box)

	!FreeRam = $0DC4|!addr

;Sound effect that plays when you shoot sprite

	!SoundEf = $06

;Sprites to shoot:
;This depends on your
;+!ExtendedOffset makes so the extended sprite spawn is a custom one. Removing it will make you shoot original sprites!

	db $01+!ExtendedOffset ; default boomerang
	db $02+!ExtendedOffset ; default shuriken
	db $03+!ExtendedOffset ; default iceball
	db $04+!ExtendedOffset ; default bubble

;X/Y displacement:
;X: Is added to mario's placement to determie where sprite should be spawn. depends on facing.
;XHi: don't touch it, it's high byte thingy, related with offcamera positions. 
;Y: High or low spawn position 

XDisplace:
	db $FC,$04
