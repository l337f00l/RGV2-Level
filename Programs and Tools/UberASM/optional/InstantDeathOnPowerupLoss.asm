;This piece of ASM makes the player instantly die, when he loses his powerup.
;This ASM is meant to be inserted as gamemode 14 or as level-asm. It runs on every (sub)screen in a level.
;See idoplLevel.asm for more customizability (Should be chosen, if you need the extra options).
;Version 2.1
;Created by Badummzi, small optimizations by Maarfy

; SJC: added small Yoshi/star power check (thanks KevinM), 
; and then modified so that "Yoshi loss" doesn't play
; simultaneously with normal death sound when you die with Yoshi
