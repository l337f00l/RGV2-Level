Thank you for downloading!
This is a GFX file containing graphics for SMAS:SMB3 styled Ice and Frozen Blocks.

The file contains both the original SMAS:SMB3 ice blocks, as well as others i drew based on their style. 
Some of these blocks were made specifically to be used with Ersanio's "Icy/Frozen Blocks Pack". (Though they can also be used decoratively)

Here's a link for Ersanio's Frozen Blocks pack: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=4069

Here are the file's contents, and how they are meant to be used:

* The 4 blocks on the left are Ice Blocks meant to be used as solid blocks. These are the original 16x16 and 32x32 SMAS:SMB3 ice blocks, as well as 16x32 and 32x16 versions of them.

* The other 11 blocks on the right side of the file are the Frozen Blocks for Ersanio's block pack.
- The Frozen Block, Frozen Coin, Frozen Question Block, Frozen Note Block, Frozen On/Off Block and Frozen Rotating Coin are quite self explanatory, as the Block Pack has one specific block for each of these (The rotating coin is supposed to be the "Coin from Range" block)
- The 32x32 Frozen block is made for both the 32x32 ice block, as well as the 32x32 dividing block.
- The Frozen Muncher and Frozen P-Switch are default graphics. The custom blocks they are meant for can be customized to turn into any block/sprite, so i could only make graphics for their default configuration.
- The Frozen Yoshi Coin is similar to the previous case, it's a default graphic, as the custom block it is meant for can be customized to spawn any 1x2 tiles, and i could only make graphics for their default configuration.
- The Frozen Turn Block is meant to be used with the "ice_map16++" and "ice_map16--" blocks. These blocks are entirely dependent on where you place them in the Map16, so it's basically impossible for me to make graphics that would fit for them. So i made the Turn Block just for the sake of having a graphic for them.

Notes: 
- These graphics use palette row 6, so i could use the original colors for the Coins/Blocks (which means the palette will restore the original palette 6 row when imported). The colors for the ice blocks themselves are on the right side of palette 6, so they don't replace any color originally used by the game. Note that, because of this, some graphics (namely the Frozen P-Switch, Frozen On/Off Block and Frozen Note Block) have some slightly different colors than their original version. 
- The ExGFX file is meant to be used in the BG2 slot, so it doesn't replace the original graphics of any level.

Well, that's it! 
Credits aren't mandatory, but would be much appreciated! =D
