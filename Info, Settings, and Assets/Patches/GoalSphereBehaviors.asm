;Sprites become Coins by Goal Sphere
;by Isikoro, with edits by SJandCharlieTheCat
;If !FreezeMarioCompletely set, use Uber FreezeMarioCompletelyOnFlag.asm, to freeze in horizontal levels too

!MusicRAMTrigger = $0DF2 ; if set, will skip the end-level music, and keep playing your normal level music
!FreezeMarioCompletely = 0
!GoalWalk = 1	; If 0, will simply remain in place after getting, instead of walking (though still gravity)
!SpritesTurnIntoCoins = 0

; Secret exit functionality?

; The secret exit works only if the sprite is set to make the player walk
; after touching it.  It's an annoying quirk of SMW's exit handling.  It is possible
; to circumvent this by using the hex edit at $00C9FE.
